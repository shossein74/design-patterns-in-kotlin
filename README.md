<h1>Design Patterns in Kotlin</h1>
    <p>This repository showcases different <strong>Design Patterns</strong> implemented in <strong>Kotlin</strong>. The patterns are organized into three main categories:</p>

<h2>🛠 Design Patterns Categories</h2>
<p>Design patterns can be grouped into three main categories:</p>

<h3>1. Creational Patterns 🏗️</h3>
<p>Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a way that is suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process to make it more flexible and dynamic.</p>

<h3>2. Structural Patterns 🏗️</h3>
<p>Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects. They help ensure that the relationships between objects are well-structured and efficient.</p>

<h3>3. Behavioral Patterns 🤖</h3>
<p>Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, making sure that objects can work together and communicate in an effective way.</p>
